# 🚽 Smart Toilet Automation System

This Arduino project automates restroom access control using sensors, a servo door, a DC motor, and Blynk integration. It enhances hygiene and monitoring by allowing remote control based on flow, distance, and presence detection.

## 📌 Features

- 🚶 IR sensor detects human presence.
- 💧 Flow sensor monitors water flow rate.
- 📏 Ultrasonic sensor checks water level.
- 🔐 Servo motor controls the door.
- ⚙️ DC motor controlled based on sensor states.
- 📲 Blynk app used for:
  - Unlocking the door remotely.
  - Receiving usage alerts.

## 🧠 Logic Flow

1. IR sensor detects entry and increments a count.
2. When `count >= 20`, a message is sent to Blynk to unlock the door.
3. On even counts:
   - Ultrasonic sensor checks if water level is sufficient.
   - If yes, opens the door and runs DC motor.
   - If water is low, closes the door and stops the motor.
4. On odd counts:
   - Flow sensor monitors usage.
   - If flow rate > threshold, starts the motor.
   - If not, stops the motor.
